Hi! My name’s Riju, and I’m an Accelerated Master’s graduate from the University of Pennsylvania with an MSE in Robotics, a BSE in Computer Science, and a minor in Statistics. Over the years, I’ve cultivated a deep passion for exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence, robotics, and machine learning.

Whether exploring cutting-edge concepts in embodied AI, developing systems for multi-object manipulation, or evaluating reinforcement learning methods for dynamic control tasks, I’ve built a solid foundation in designing and implementing intelligent robotic systems. My experiences include creating visual imitation learning pipelines for contact-rich manipulation, benchmarking deep reinforcement learning algorithms, and fine-tuning multimodal models for robotics applications. These projects have strengthened my expertise in deep learning, computer vision, and AI, driving my commitment to advancing robotics and AI with innovative solutions.

When I’m not coding or diving into research, I enjoy running, hiking, exploring different cuisines, playing the piano, listening to neuroscience and cognitive science podcasts, and reading sci-fi novels. One of the most transformative experiences of my life has been my time with [Penn Masala](https://www.pennmasala.com), the world’s first South Asian a cappella group. Over the past four years, I had the honor of performing at prestigious venues such as the White House, the Paris Olympics, and during a 6-city tour of India. Whether singing in front of thousands or arranging a complex musical piece, Penn Masala allowed me to celebrate my cultural heritage and grow both as an artist and a collaborator.

At my core, I’m motivated by a genuine curiosity and the drive to make meaningful contributions — through robotics, music, as well as the connections I build along the way.
